# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: it is the the systematic approach to developing, operating and maintaining software by using engineering principles and practices .
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering involves systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approaches to development  , operation and maintenance of software. while it focuses on coding it also focuses on designing,  documenting,  testing and maintaining software. Traditional programming is the act of writing codes to to solve specific problems  without following structured methodologies.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. requirements gathering and analysis: the gathering and defining clear ,concise and detailed requirements from stakeholders.
2. system design: translating the requirements into a representation  of the software 
3. implementation: this is the actual coding phase where software is built according to the design specifications
4 testing: verifying the software works as expected including unit testing, integration testing,  system testing and acceptance testing.
5. deployment: releasing the software for production use
6. Maintenance: updating and enhancing the software to adapt to changes
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile:
Iterative: develops software incrementally in short iterations.
Flexibility:emphasises adaptability to changing requirements.
Collaboration: promotes continuous customer involvement and feedback 

Waterfall:
Sequential: Progress linearly through predefined phases.
Rigidity: less flexible to changes once a phase is completed.
Documentation: Emphasizes extensive documentation at each stage.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile is preferred for projects where requirements are likely to evolve and Flexibility is crucial. 
Waterfall is suitable for projects where requirements are well defined and stable where planning and documentation is paramount.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Involves eliciting, documentingm validating and managing software through the SDLC. it ensures that the stakeholder needs are correctly understood and implemented. 
Software Design Principles:


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?Modularity in software design involves dividing a system into smaller, manageable and independent modules
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Unit testing: tests individual components or modules 
Integration testing: tests interactions between integrated components.
system testing: tests the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: tests whether the system meets the user requirements.
importance is that it ensures software quality, identifies defects early and ensures reliability and security.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. They manage changes to source code over time. they track modifications , enable collaboration and facilitate the merging of changes from multiple contributors. for example Git and SVN
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
a software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. responsibilities include defining project scope, managing resources,  scheduling, risk management and stakeholder communication.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after delivery to correct defects, improve performance,  adapt to changes and enhance functionalities. 
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:  

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:Ethical issues include privacy violations, biased algorithms and impact in society. Engineers can adhere to ethical standards by promoting transparency,  respecting user privacy and designing inclusive and fair systems.

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
